# UCLA Computer Science - 2005

This repository contains sample projects developed for Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Degree at UCLA. Each directory contains source code for the projects developed in respective courses. The sample projects here are prior to 2005 and should only be used as references for learning purposes. These projects were developed by students (R. Javier Vega & Eddie Esquivel) while learning key CS and EE at UCLA. Therefore they should NOT be considered for production or professional environments.
