# UCLA Computer Science Projects - 2005

This repository contains sample projects developed CS classes at UCLA. Each directory contains the source code for the projects developed in that class. The sample projects here are prior to 2005 and should only be used as reference for learning purposes. These projects were developed by students while learning key CS concepts and should not be considered production level code.
