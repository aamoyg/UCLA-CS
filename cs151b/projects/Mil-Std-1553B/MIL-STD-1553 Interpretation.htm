  <P>Reliable and timely transfer of data between avionics systems is a 
  necessity in military and civil aircraft design. a powerful motivation for 
  development of new data transmission systems has been the prolific growth in 
  digital computing technology providing increasing opportunities for more 
  modular, flexible and reliable avionics systems. This has resulted in a 
  universal move from analogue to more rugged, digital data transmission. Thus, 
  the emergence of the Avionics Databus system. Over the last 30 years, much 
  work has gone into exploring new techniques for the transmission of 
  information in aircraft. One approach that has emerged as a truly 
  internationally recognized, generally used and commercially successful 
  standard in the avionics industry is MIL-STD-1553.</P>
  <H4><B><I>MIL-STD-1553</I></B> </H4>
  <P>MIL-STD-1553 originated around 1972 and is published by the SAE, and was 
  specifically developed for military avionics applications. It is a very 
  successful standard, now used on nearly all new and upgrade programs in space, 
  fixed- and rotary-wing military applications.</P>
  <P>1553 operates bidirectionally on a multisource, multisink basis and each 
  unit on the bus can communicate with all the others. Up to 32 users 
  (terminals) can be connected to the bus with data transmitted serially at 
  1Mbps in words of 20 bits. Normal system design involves dual redundancy, 
  whereby the complete cable and coupling assembly is duplicated such that if a 
  failure appears in the primary assembly, the secondary can be used.</P>
  <P>Transmission on the bus is managed through a 'Command--Response' protocol 
  whereby all transactions are authorized exlusively by a master, termed the bus 
  controller (BC). Other terminals are called remote terminasl (RTs) of which 
  there can be between 1 and 31 (each with 31 subaddresses) or monitors (Ms). 
  Various message formats are supported (BC to RT, RT to BC, and RT to RT, along 
  with bradcast-type transmissions where one user can communicate with ohter 
  users). In the vast majority of applications, connections to the bus are 
  achieved through transformer couplers thereby providing good electrical 
  isolation between transmit and receive circuitry.</P>
  <P>To provide useful assistance for the new user, an interpretation and 
  commentary on MIL-STD-1553 has been generated by SBS Technologies. </P>
