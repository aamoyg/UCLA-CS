      <P><STRONG>Overview</STRONG> <BR><A 
      href="http://www.condoreng.com/products/protocols/1553.shtml">MIL-STD-1553</A> 
      is a military standard that defines the electrical and protocol 
      characteristics for a data bus. A data bus is used to provide a medium for 
      the exchange of data and information between various systems. It is 
      similar to what the personal computer and office automation industry has 
      dubbed a Local Area Network (LAN).</P><A name=app>
      <P><STRONG>MIL-STD-1553 Applications</STRONG> <BR>Since its inception, 
      MIL-STD-1553 has found numerous applications. Notice 2 to the standard has 
      even removed all references to "aircraft" or "airborne" so as not to limit 
      its use. While all the programs to which the standard has been applied are 
      too numerous to be covered here, the following is a summary of its 
      uses.</P>
      <P>While the standard has been applied to satellites as well as payloads 
      within the space shuttle (it is even being used on the International Space 
      Station), its military applications are the most numerous and far ranging. 
      It has been employed on large transports, aerial refuelers, and bombers, 
      tactical fighters, and helicopters. It is even contained within missiles 
      and serves, in some instances, as the primary interface between the 
      aircraft and a missile. The Navy has applied the data bus to both surface 
      and subsurface ships. The Army, in addition to its helicopters, has put 
      1553 into tanks and howitzers.</P>
      <P>Commercial applications have applied the standard to systems including 
      subways, for example the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), and manufacturing 
      production lines. </P>
      <P>MIL-STD-1553B has also been accepted and implemented by NATO and many 
      foreign governments. The UK has issued Def Stan 00-18 (Part 2) and NATO 
      has published STANAG 3838 AVS, both of which are versions of 
      MIL-STD-1553B. </P>
      <P>The broad acceptance and application of MIL-STD-1553B has also fostered 
      the development of other standardization efforts. MIL-STD-1773 is a fiber 
      optic version of 1553B. And MIL-STD-1760A, the Aircraft/Store 
      Interconnect, has 1553B embedded within it.</P><A name=def>
      <P><STRONG>MIL-STD-1553B Defined</STRONG> <BR>So now that we understand 
      the driving need for the development of a data bus, and a little of its 
      history and application, what exactly is MIL-STD-1553B? A summary of the 
      characteristics of MIL-STD-1553B is found in Table 1.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the data bus is to move data between black 
      boxes. How these boxes are connected and the methodology with which the 
      communication is accomplished is central to the operation of the data bus. 
      </P><A name=hard>
      <P><STRONG>Hardware Elements</STRONG> <BR>MIL-STD-1553 defines certain 
      aspects regarding the design of the data bus system and the black boxes to 
      which the data bus is connected. The standard defines four hardware 
      elements. These are: 
      <UL>
        <LI>The transmission media 
        <LI>Remote terminals 
        <LI>Bus controllers 
        <LI>Bus monitors </LI></UL>
      <P></P><A name=trans>
      <P><STRONG>Transmission Media</STRONG> <BR>The transmission media, or data 
      bus, is defined as a twisted shielded pair transmission line consisting of 
      the main bus and a number of stubs. There is one stub for each terminal 
      connected to the bus. The main MIL-STD-1553 data bus is terminated at each 
      end with a resistance equal to the cable's characteristic impedance (plus 
      or minus two percent). This termination makes the data bus behave 
      electrically like an infinite transmission line.</P><A name=rem>
      <P><STRONG>Remote Terminals</STRONG> <BR>Remote terminals are defined 
      within the standard as "All terminals not operating as the bus controller 
      or as a bus monitor". Therefore if it is not a controller, monitor, or the 
      main bus or stub, it must be a remote terminal. The remote terminal 
      comprises the electronics necessary to transfer data between the data bus 
      and the subsystem. So what is a subsystem? For 1553 applications, the 
      subsystem is the sender or user of the data being transferred.</P><A 
      name=busc>
      <P><STRONG>Bus Controller</STRONG> <BR>The bus controller is responsible 
      for directing the flow of data on the MIL-STD-1553 data bus. While several 
      terminals may be capable of performing as the bus controller, only one bus 
      controller may be active at a time. The bus controller is the only one 
      allowed to issue commands onto the data bus. The commands may be for the 
      transfer of data or the control and management of the bus (referred to as 
      mode commands). </P><A name=busm>
      <P><STRONG>Bus Monitor</STRONG> <BR>A bus monitor is a terminal that 
      listens (monitors) to the exchange of information on the MIL-STD-1553 data 
      bus. The standard strictly defines how bus monitors may be used, stating 
      that the information obtained by a bus monitor be used "for off-line 
      applications (e.g., flight test recording, maintenance recording or 
      mission analysis) or to provide the back-up bus controller sufficient 
      information to take over as the bus controller." A monitor may collect all 
      the data from the bus or may collect selected data. The reason for 
      restricting its use is that while a monitor may collect data, it deviates 
      from the command-response protocol of the standard, in that a monitor is a 
      passive device that doesn't transmit a status word and therefore cannot 
      report on the status of the information transferred. </P><A name=term>
      <P><STRONG>Terminal Hardware</STRONG> <BR>The electronic hardware between 
      a remote terminal, bus controller, and bus monitor doesn't differ much. 
      Both the remote terminal and bus controller (and bus monitor if it is also 
      a remote terminal) must have the transmitters/receivers and 
      encoders/decoders to format and transfer data. The requirements upon the 
      transceivers and the encoders/decoders don't vary between the hardware 
      elements.</P>
