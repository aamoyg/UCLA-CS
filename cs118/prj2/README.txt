This project implements FEC and CRC algorithms for transfering of data over the network. 
This project uses a library to specially corrupt data being transmitted and simulate
packet loss in the real world. 

The use of CRC and FEC can verify the integrity of the data trasferred.

This project also uses UDP to transfer a file over the network and test FEC&CRC.
