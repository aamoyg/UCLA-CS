*** CS118 PROJECT #1 INSTALL ***

This program consists of two programs that run together:
A server part and a client part.

The first step to install the program is to compile it using make:

Under the directory with the uncompress files type:

bash$ make

That should build the server and the client.

Note:
There is a Makefile provided with the program that should compile
in most unix systems. However, it is nescesarry to have installed
a c compiler like gcc and maketools.


CLIENT INSTALLATION:
====================

The next step is to copy the file: webclient.cgi to a directory 
that can be executed by the web browser. The idea is that somebody
could type http://www.yourcompany.com/cgi-bin/webclient.cgi
and the program would be executed.


SERVER INSTALLATION:
====================

The next part is to have the server for the program running 
on the machine to be connected.

After compiling the program, type:

bash$ ./server 

to execute the server. If the server is running it would show
the port where it is listening and it would output the
connections with also the output.


Thats it.
