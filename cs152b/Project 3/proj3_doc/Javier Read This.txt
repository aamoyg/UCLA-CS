Since you guys told me to do 4 waveforms only, I choose the ones we didnt test in our programs
pop, push, jal and jr are used here, the code that we havent tested were some tedious ALU function like add, subtract, shift...etc
To discribe each waveform, just rephrase the VHDL code into words
Remember to state each waveform to its associate .do file

sth add to the waveform: whenever you see a line across the waveform, please refer to the value high-lighted on the far left hand side and describe how it changes (easy to understand what is going on if check back the VHDL code)

the project 3 files I send to you have already clear implementation data
 Number of SLICEs                  742 out of 768    96%
