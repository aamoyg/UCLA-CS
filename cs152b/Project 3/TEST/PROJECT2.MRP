Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:95 - IBUF symbol "xlxi_16" (output signal=xlxn_1) is promoted to
   indicate the use of GCLKIOB site.
WARNING:MapLib:135 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFG
   symbol "xlxi_17" (output signal=clk) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads.
WARNING:DesignRules:372 - Netcheck: Gated clock. Clock net
   xlxi_30_pctofpgainterface_pportinterface_N361 is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:62 - All of the external outputs in this design are using slew rate
   limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the schematic.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 288 block(s) removed
   3 block(s) optimized away
 286 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
