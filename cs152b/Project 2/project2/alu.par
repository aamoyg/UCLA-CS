WARNING:Route:49 - The signal "xlxi_15_xlxi_23/co_dummy" has no loads so was not
   routed. 

This design was run without timing constraints.  It is likely that much better
circuit performance can be obtained by trying either or both of the following:

  - Enabling the Delay Based Cleanup router pass, if not already enabled
  - Supplying timing constraints in the input design
