<h1>Project 2. Web page comparison server</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Your boss at Jerry-built Computer Networks Corp. (JCN) complains
that JCN is maintaining millions of web pages, many of which are
nearly copies, and that JCN should attempt to find the web pages that
are nearly copies and work to unify them. Your overall job will be to
write an application that looks through JCN's web pages, and finds
pages that are similar. Your initial assignment is to write a simple
comparison server that looks for RURLs (as defined in <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall03/cs131/hw/hw3.html">Homework 3</a>) common to two web pages. Your boss
also wants you to think of ways to improve your server so that it is
useful even to nontechnical users.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Write a web server that repeatedly does the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Accept a query that uses a URL of the form
  <samp>&lt;http://</samp><var>host</var><samp>:</samp><var>port</var><samp>/compare-rurls.rpy?old=</samp><var>OLDURL</var><samp>&amp;new=</samp><var>NEWURL</var><samp>&gt;</samp>.</li>
 <li>For each such query, fetch the resources <var>OLDRESOURCE</var> and
  <var>NEWRESOURCE</var> located by <var>OLDURL</var> and
  <var>NEWURL</var>.</li>
 <li>Generate a <samp>text/plain</samp>
  (<em>not</em> <samp>text/html</samp>) response that contains the
  following three output sections, separated by empty lines:

   <ul>
   <li>RURLs that appear only in <var>OLDRESOURCE</var>.</li>
   <li>RURLs that appear only in <var>NEWRESOURCE</var>.</li>
   <li>RURLs that appear in both resources.</li>
   </ul>

  The response should contain exactly two empty lines, to separate the
  three output sections. Each section should be free of duplicate
  lines, and each section's lines should be sorted in ascending ASCII
  order. If a resource cannot be retrieved, the corresponding section
  should be a single line containing a decimal integer indicating the
  HTTP status code (e.g., <samp>404</samp> for resource not found),
  and the last section should be empty.
 </li>
</ol>

<p>Implement your web server with <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/products/twisted">Twisted</a>, an
event-driven networking framework written in Python. <a href="http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.1.0/">Twisted
documentation</a> is available. You can find a copy of the Twisted
1.1.0 source code and documentation in
<samp>~cs131ta/src/Twisted-1.1.0</samp> on SEASnet. A compressed tar
image is also available in
<samp>~cs131ta/src/tarpit/Twisted-1.1.0.tar.gz</samp> and <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/products/download">at
Twisted Matrix Laboratories</a>.</p>

<p>You may find it necessary to modify Twisted. If so, minimize the
number of changes to the existing source code. For example, instead of
modifying an existing class, use a new subclass of your own instead,
whenever possible.</p>

<p>An <samp>.rpy</samp> file is a <dfn>resource script</dfn>: it is
like a normal Python <samp>.py</samp> file, except that there is one
extra restriction: an <samp>.rpy</samp> file must define a global
variable <samp>resource</samp> whose value is an instance of a
subclass of <a href="http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.1.0/api/twisted.web.resource.Resource.html"><samp>twisted.web.resource.Resource</samp></a>. By
default, the Twisted web server renders the resource in response to a
URL naming the resource script. Please see the <a href="http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.1.0/api/twisted.web.resource.Resource.html#render"><samp>twisted.web.resource.Resource.render
API</samp></a> for a few more details, but the full story is best
discovered by reading the Twisted source code mentioned below. A
simple example <samp>.rpy</samp> file can be found in
<samp>~cs131ta/twisted/public-html/test.rpy</samp> on SEASnet.</p>

<p><var>OLDURL</var> and <var>NEWURL</var> may need to be escaped so
that the overall query is a valid URI. For example, if either URL
contains <samp>#</samp> it must be represented using the
standard escape sequence <samp>%23</samp> since any <samp>#</samp>
would be interpreted as the start of a fragment after the overall
query. Please see <a href="http://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1808.txt">Internet RFC
1808</a> ยง2.2 for details.</p>

<p>Escapes can also be used to represent arbitrary characters within
URLs. For example, to compare <samp>http://www.cs.ucla.edu/</samp> to
<samp>http://www.seas.ucla.edu/seasnet/</samp>, you might use either
of the following queries:</p>

<pre><samp>http://</samp><var>host</var><samp>:</samp><var>port</var><samp>/compare-rurls.rpy?old=http://www.cs.ucla.edu/&amp;new=http://www.seas.ucla.edu/seasnet/
http://</samp><var>host</var><samp>:</samp><var>port</var><samp>/compare-rurls.rpy?old=http%3a%2f%2Fwww.cs.ucla.edu%2f&amp;new=%68ttp%3A/%2fwww.seas.ucla.edu%2fseasnet%2f
</samp></pre>

<h2>Suggestions for testing</h2>

<p>Make sure that your web server outputs exactly the correct text,
with no leading or trailing white space on any line, as your server
will be tested by a persnickety script that considers spaces to be
important.</p>

<p>To figure out which SEASnet host you're running on, type the shell
command <samp>hostname</samp>. If it outputs the string
<samp>landfair</samp>, you are running on
<samp>landfair.seas.ucla.edu</samp>. To simplify exposition the rest
of this section assumes that you're running on
<samp>landfair</samp>.</p>

<p>To avoid clashes with other people's web servers, use a port number
that is 14000 greater than your student ID modulo 424. For example, if
your student ID is 123456789, then use port 14285 (because 14285 is
14000 + 123456789%424, as you can easily confirm by typing that
expression into an interactive Python session) by using the
<samp>--port=14285</samp> option when generating your web server with
<samp>mktap</samp> as described below.</p>

<p>Here's a recipe for getting started with Twisted. Execute the
following shell commands:</p>

<pre><samp>   # Set environment variables appropriately.
   setenv PYTHONPATH /u/cs/class/cs131/cs131ta/src/Twisted-1.1.0
   setenv PATH /u/cs/class/cs131/cs131ta/src/Twisted-1.1.0/bin:$PATH

   # Make a new directory and build a web server that will run in it.
   mkdir twisted
   cd twisted
   mktap web --path=public-html --port=14285

   # Put your web pages in this directory.  Here is a sample:
   mkdir public-html
   cp ~cs131ta/twisted/public-html/test.rpy public-html/test.rpy

   # Run your web server.  Always use "-n", for debug mode.
   twistd -n -f web.tap
   # You should see some log messages starting with "Log opened"
   # and ending with "set uid/gid".

   # Now you can test your web server.
   # You should see more log messages as you test.

   # Type Control-C to exit your web server.
</samp></pre>

<p>To test whether your server is working with the sample web pages
mentioned above, use a browser to visit
<samp>&lt;http://landfair.seas.ucla.edu:14285/test.rpy?old=http://www.cs.ucla.edu/&amp;new=http://www.seas.ucla.edu/seasnet/&gt;</samp>.
You should get a Test Web Page that lists its URL, URI, and query
arguments, among other things.</p>

<h2>Submitting your work</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall03/cs131/seasnet.html">Submit</a> a file named
<samp>pr2.tgz</samp>. It should be a <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">gzipped</a> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/">tar</a> file containing all
the source files that are needed to build and run your project. One
of these files must be called <samp>written-by.txt</samp> and must
contain your name and student ID. For example, you might use the
following command to create <samp>pr2.tgz</samp>:</p>

<pre><samp>   cd $HOME/twisted
   tar cf - written-by.txt *.py public-html | gzip -9 &gt;pr2.tgz
</samp></pre>

<p>This
causes <samp>tar</samp> to generate a single output stream containing
the named files; the <samp>|</samp> is the Unix pipe symbol, which causes
<samp>tar</samp>'s output to be sent as input to
<samp>gzip</samp>. Don't forget the <samp>-</samp> (separated by spaces)
after the <samp>cf</samp>.</p>

<p>Before submitting <samp>pr2.tgz</samp>, test it by running the
following commands:</p>

<pre><samp>   setenv PATH /u/cs/class/cs131/cs131ta/src/Twisted-1.1.0/bin:$PATH

   mkdir testdirectory
   cd testdirectory
   # Substitute your own port for "14285".
   mktap web --path=public-html --port=14285
   gunzip &lt;../pr2.tgz | tar xf -
   setenv PYTHONPATH `pwd`:/u/cs/class/cs131/cs131ta/src/Twisted-1.1.0
   twistd -n -f web.tap

   # [Test your web server here.]

   # When testing is done, clean up as follows.
   # First, type Control-C.
   # Then, remove your test copy as follows:
   cd ..
   rm -fr testdirectory
</samp></pre>

<h2>Optional extra work</h2>

<p>For extra credit, you can do some extra work for this project. If
you'd like to do this, please send email to Michael proposing the
extra work that you'd like to do. Your proposal should be in the form
of ASCII text (not HTML or PostScript or anything fancy; just ASCII)
and should be in Michael's mailbox by noon Friday, 2003-11-21. Your
proposal should be succinct but should have enough detail so that
we'll know how to test your extension. Michael will respond with his
estimate of how many extra points your proposal will be worth. You may
submit up to three proposals and may implement any combination of the
accepted proposals, so long as their combined value is at least 20
points extra.</p>

<p>If you submit nontrivial work for extra credit, you may work
together with one other person in this class (from either
section). This is an exception to the ordinary class rule that all
work submitted must be your own. The extra work is defined to be
"nontrivial" if we evaluate your extra-work proposal(s) to be worth at
least 25 points extra.</p>

<p>In your joint submission you must identify which part each coworker
was primarily responsible for; one way to do this is to split your
work by source files, and to put a comment "<samp># Written by
</samp><var>YOUR NAME</var><samp>.</samp>" near the start of each
source file. The file <samp>written-by.txt</samp> should list both
coworkers' names and student IDs.</p>

<p>Here are some sketches of ideas for extra work, along with our
guess of how many extra points will be awarded for each idea, over
and above the 100 points awarded for the base implementation (your
mileage may vary depending on your exact proposal):</p>

<ul>
 <li>(approximately 10 points extra) Use a form for the query, and
  report the result using a nice HTML format rather than as plain
  text.</li>

 <li>(approximately 20 points extra) Parse any HTML resources as HTML
  instead of as text, and report URIs found, not RURLs. For example,
  if an HTML resource contains an A element that has an HREF
  attribute, report the contents of that attribute.</li>

 <li>(approximately 30 points extra) Instead of comparing two
  resources, use the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">Google Web
  API</a> to compare one resource to its Google cache counterpart. Use
  <a href="http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/">SOAPpy</a> to access the
  Google Web API.</li>

 <li>(approximately 50 points extra) Compare the two resources'
  contents instead of just their links, using a general-purpose
  comparison function, and output a summary that looks like the
  originals, but with annotations describing where they differ, much
  as Homework 1 output a description of where its two inputs
  differed.</li> </ul>
