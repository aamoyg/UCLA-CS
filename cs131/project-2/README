  Implementation of Extra Credit:

  Within this project there are 6 extra files that implement the
  extra credit option. This files are:


	extra1-credit.html
	extra1-credit.rpy
	extra1.py
	extra2-credit.html
	extra2-credit.rpy
	extra2.py

  To test the extra credit option 1 and 2 there two .html files 
  point to the script that runs the code. Therefore, to test it
  after the web server is running connect to the root of the
  server, where the files will be listed. After that, you can
  click on any of the .html extra 1 and 2 files. 

  This files are forms where old and new urls can be inputted
  and the script will be called showing the output to the browser.

  Both files have default values for input pointing to the same
  location, therefore the output is expected to be valid.

  Both extra credit scripts descrive the part of the assignment
  that they implement and the estimated amount of points expected.

  The files .rpy are the script that talks to twisted and the .py
  are the actual code base written in python.
